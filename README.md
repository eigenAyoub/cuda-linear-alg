This is not a proof that you can do backprop with a pen. It's supposed to be nice journey around CUDA/NVIDA ecosystem.

* Have fun!
* Use tools (profilers, etc), and try to be a professional.
* Always ask, can you do it better?   

Steps:

1. Load mnist.
2. Basic forward pass.
3. Check correctness.
4. Optimize code.

Few small trips:
* Mini blog on softmax, compare to CuDNN.
* Profile your code, use NVIDIA NSIGHTs.
